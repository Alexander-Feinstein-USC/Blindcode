Blindcode - Hide Leetcode question difficulty tags with the flip of a switch!

Unlike similar extensions, Blindcode works on every page on both the old version and new version of Leetcode.

Useful for overcoming mental barriers caused by intimidating Leetcode difficulty tags. Works very well with the "pick one" question feature on Leetcode.
